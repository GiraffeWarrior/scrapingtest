## Description

Twilio.py requires creating an additional python file containing account information and phone numbers to use. The Scraping.py file requests the html text from the website, writes it to an html file and then does the same once again two seconds later. It then runs both files through an html parser that strips them of tags and writes the plain text to two new files. I could not figure out how to compare them in time.
